/// - a component, whose
/// - encoding version is 0xd exactly, and who
/// - does not contain any value-level aliases, and whose
/// - final export is a component type
///
/// Anything that is a "binary-encoded WIT" produced by a recent
/// toolchain should satisfy this. On violation, this function will
/// panic with an error message.
///
/// The reason we look for the last export is that the WIT binary
/// encoding encodes any instance type imported/exported from the main
/// component (a/k/a WIT world) as a type export, followed by a final
/// type export for the type of the main component/world.
///
/// TODO: Allow the user to specify a specific export to use (or a WIT
/// world name), since current WIT tooling can generate encoded
/// packages with multiple component types in them.
///
/// TODO: Encode even more assumptions about WIT package structure
/// (which are already there in rtypes/host/guest) and allow looking
/// for a specific named world, instead of simply grabbing the last
/// export.
